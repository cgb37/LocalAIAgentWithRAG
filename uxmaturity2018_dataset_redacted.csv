We have multiple teams in the library to help with service design, conducting and gathering user research, and helping library staff think more about the user in their everyday work. We also have a couple Special Interest Groups (SIGs) dedicated to user research, UX, and assessment. We have a Digital Accessibility Team that shares their expertise on digital accessibility standards and accessible design best practices, provides accessibility audits to library staff building tools or evaluating electronic resources, etc. They essentially strive to improve the virtual experiences for those with disabilities. 



We also have multiple departments within the library with UX expertise. For example, in Library IT, there is a department called [redacted] with several people dedicated to user research, design, content strategy, accessibility, and overall improving the user experience of our web applications across the web presence. They are taking a more holistic approach to a comprehensive virtual space redesign, including the libraryâ€™s website as the core, but extending more broadly to the libraryâ€™s whole suite of web-based applications and products that have a public-facing user interface. They are also refining a digital playbook and building a design system that will have unified set of principles, guidelines, and reusable patterns used in the creation of websites and web applications; this includes content, design, and accessibility guidelines as well as code for all library staff to use. 



There's another department in Operations called [redacted] that focuses on the UX of our physical spaces. They also do a lot of user research and design to help with way-finding, signage, designing spaces based on services and user needs, etc. They work very closely with [redacted]. 



Finally, in addition to all the folks in the library who do assessment/have assessment in their title, we've just hired a new Assessment Specialist in the Deans' Office to help coordinate all the assessment efforts in each of the 8 divisions, and the new Senior UX Specialist in [redacted] will be working closely with this person on UX strategy to help with future directions and library-wide assessment and planning.
