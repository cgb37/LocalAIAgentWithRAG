# LocalAIAgentWithRAG

LocalAIAgentWithRAG is a local implementation of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Agent utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance context-aware responses by leveraging external knowledge sources.

This project is designed to keep everything running locally, ensuring better data privacy and low-latency inference. It is perfect for applications requiring local knowledge search and processing in combination with generative AI.

---

## Features

- **Local Execution**: Ensures maximum data security and privacy by executing all processes locally without relying on external servers.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines generative AI with a document retrieval mechanism to provide contextually accurate responses based on input queries.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily adaptable to additional knowledge sources and algorithms.
- **Support for Popular Models**: Preloaded with AI models like `llama3.2` for RAG and `mxbai-embed-large` for embeddings.
- **Python Environment**: Simple Python-based environment setup using `venv`.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the project, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Python 3.8 or Higher**: The project is built with Python, and a version >= 3.8 is recommended.
2. **Pip**: A package manager for Python.
3. **ollama CLI**: Needed to download and set up local AI models. You can find details [here](https://ollama.com/).
4. **Basic Knowledge Sources (Optional)**: Documents or databases that can supply the additional context required for your RAG pipeline.

---

## Installation Setup

Follow these instructions to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell script
git clone <repository-url>
   cd LocalAIAgentWithRAG
```

2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
```shell script
python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install required Python packages:
```shell script
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download and configure models via `ollama` CLI:
```shell script
ollama pull llama3.2
   ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
```

---

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can begin using the local RAG-powered AI agent:

1. Activate the Python virtual environment:
```shell script
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Launch the application (example command):
```shell script
python main.py
```

3. Start interacting with the agent by providing queries. For example, ask questions like:
```
"Summarize [document or database entry]."
   "Tell me about [specific topic]."
```

The system will use the retrieval-augmented generation technique to fetch context, process it using the `llama3.2` model, and provide a highly contextualized response.

---

## Local Models

The project uses the following models provided by `ollama`:

- **Llama 3.2**: A powerful language model designed for generating contextual responses.
- **MXBAI Embed Large**: A large embedding model for document vectorization and similarity searches.

These models are downloaded and stored locally, ensuring low latency and data privacy.

---

## Key Components

- **Local RAG Pipeline**: The agent's pipeline integrates document retrieval, embedding generation, and natural language generation in a self-contained environment.
- **Model Orchestration**: Powered by `ollama`, enabling seamless integration of various language models.
- **Document Preprocessing**: Includes tokenization, vectorization, and contextual keyword extraction to improve the quality of knowledge retrieval.

---

## Future Plans

- Adding support for customized retrievers to enhance compatibility with enterprise-grade knowledge bases.
- Expanding to other generative models for domain-specific applications.
- Integrating a GUI or web-based interface for non-technical users.
- Enhancing document ingestion pipelines for real-time updates.
